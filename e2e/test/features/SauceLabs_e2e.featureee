# Feature: buy one product at a time

Feature:  SauceLabs shopping app E2E
As a logged-in userI want to buy one of several products

Scenario Outline: log in and buy a product
Given the saucelabs URL is open at the login page 
And I log in as user "standard_user" and password "secret_sauce"
Then the cart items count is zero (not visible)
When I add "<qty>" of product "<product>" with "<identifier>" to cart
Then the cart items count increments
When I click the cart icon 
Then the “Your Cart” page appears
And the details for "<qty>" of product "<product>" and price "<price>" appear
When I click the Checkout button
Then the checkout page appears
When I enter firstName, LastName, postcode
Then the Checkout: Overview page appears 
And the correct price calculations for product "<product>" and price "<price>" appear
When I click the Finish button 
Then the order confirmation message appears
When I click the burger menu
Then the logout link appears
