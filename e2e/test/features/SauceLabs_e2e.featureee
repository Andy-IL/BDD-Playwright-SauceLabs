Feature:  SauceLabs shopping app E2E
As a logged-in user I want to buy two of one  product 

Scenario Outline: log in and buy a product
Given the saucelabs URL is open at the login page 
And I log in as user "standard_user" and password "secret_sauce"
Then the cart items count is zero (not visible)
When I add "<qty>" of product "<product>" with "<identifier>" to cart
Then the cart items count increments
And the running subtotal increases by "<price>"
When I add "1" of product "Sauce Labs Onesie" with "sauce-labs-onesie" to cart
Then the cart items count increments
And the running subtotal increases by "7.99"
When I click the cart icon 
Then the “Your Cart” page appears
# And the details for "<qty>" of product "<product>" with "<identifier>" and price "<price>" appear
When I click the Checkout button
Then the checkout page appears
When I enter firstName, LastName, postcode
Then the Checkout: Overview page appears 
And the correct price calculations for product "<product>" and price "<price>" appear
When I click the Finish button 
Then the order confirmation message appears
#  Then the order confirmation message appears
#  When I click the Back Home button 
#  Then the Products page appears
# And the cart items count is zero (not visible)
