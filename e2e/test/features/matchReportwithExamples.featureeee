Feature: Display Teams Playing Today

  As a business user
  I want to see a list of all teams playing today
  So that I can keep track of today's matches

  Scenario Outline: Display teams playing today with examples
    Given today's date is "<date>"
    When I request to see the teams playing today "<date>"
    Then the system should display the list of "<variant>" teams
    And there should be at least one "<variant>" team playing today

# # BBC Fixtures has matches every single day so we need a criterion to get no matching teams in matches  
#   Scenario: No Irish matches today
#     Given today's date is "2024-04-18"
#     And there are no Irish matches scheduled for today "2024-04-18"
#     When I request to see the teams playing today "2024-04-18"
#     Then the system should display a message indicating no Irish matches today

  Examples: 
    | date       | variant |
    | 2024-04-22 | League   |
    | 2024-04-19 | Women's |
    | 2024-04-22 | Irish |
#| 2024-04-18 | Irish   | 0
